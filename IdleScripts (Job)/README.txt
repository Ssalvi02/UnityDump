This game was suposed to be a "job" simulator, but idle.
The player would pick one out of four jobs and the gameplay would be diferent for each.
Programmer would be a more active gameplay, but with huge gains.
Cook and Hitman would be a more balanced gameplay.
And Salesman would be an true idle gameplay.

When you beat one, you would be able to pick other with a designated buff from the previous job.
Until you reached the final secret one.
